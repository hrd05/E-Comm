                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            Groovenest was founded by a group of friends who bonded over their shared love for vinyl records, live concerts, and band tees. We noticed that while there were plenty of places to buy music and apparel, few truly catered to the needs of dedicated fans. So, we set out to create a haven for music lovers where they could find not only the latest releases but also timeless classics and exclusive merchandise.
